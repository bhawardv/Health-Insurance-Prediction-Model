# Health-Insurance-Prediction-Model
The majority of the countries finalize health insurance costs based on many factors such as age, number of people in families, etc. What should be the actual health insurance price for an individual or a family is an issue for many companies. Hence, one insurance company hired you as a data scientist to predict the health insurance cost for possible future customers. They have already collected samples required to perform all data analysis and machine learning tasks. Your task is to perform all data analysis steps and finally create a machine learning model which can predict the health insurance cost.<br>

Variables in the dataset:<br>

age: age of the primary beneficiary<br>
sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male<br>
bmi: Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of body weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg/m²) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9<br>
children: number of children covered by health insurance, number of dependents<br>
